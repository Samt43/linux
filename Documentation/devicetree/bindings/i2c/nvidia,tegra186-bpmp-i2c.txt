NVIDIA Tegra186 BPMP I2C controller proxy driver.

The BPMP is the boot and power management processor embedded in Tegra SoCs.
Access to one of the I2C busses goes via the BPMP, requiring a different
'virtual' i2c driver that accesses the bus via the real i2c driver embedded
in the BPMP firmware. The binding document defines the resources/properties
that would be used by the BPMP I2c proxy driver.

Required properties:
- compatible : Should be "nvidia,tegra186-bpmp-i2c"
- nvidia,bpmp: This property must contain entry of bpmp node
- nvidia,bpmp-bus-id: Should be BPMP I2C bus id used by bpmp firmware i2c driver
- #address-cells: Address cells for I2C device address, should be 1
- #size-cells: Size of the I2C device address, should be 0

Example:
	bpmp_i2c: i2c {
		compatible = "nvidia,tegra186-bpmp-i2c";
		nvidia,bpmp = <&bpmp>;
		nvidia,bpmp-bus-id = <5>;
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;
		status = "disabled";
	};
